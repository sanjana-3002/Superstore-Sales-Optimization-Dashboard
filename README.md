## Superstore Sales Optimization Dashboard (Power BI)

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard built to uncover key levers that drive sales, profit, and customer behavior across categories, segments, and regions. This project transforms raw retail data into actionable business intelligence — revealing high-performing product bundles, optimal discount levels, and placement strategies to maximize profitability.


## What This Project Does
	•	Analyzes order-level sales data across regions, categories, and customer segments.
	•	Identifies high-impact product bundles and cross-sell opportunities.
	•	Optimizes pricing and discount strategies based on profitability insights.
	•	Visualizes KPIs with dynamic filters for segment, region, and time period.
	•	Guides merchandising and placement decisions using data-driven insights.

## Workflow
	1.	Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed the Superstore dataset in Power Query.
	2.	Data Modeling: Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables (Orders, Date, Product, Customer, Region).
	3.	DAX Measures: Built KPIs for Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Discount, Quantity, and YoY/MTD trends.
	4.	Visualization: Created interactive cross-filter visuals for category, segment, and regional deep dives.
	5.	Insights: Added co-purchase and discount-profit analysis to highlight bundle performance and margin protection zones.

## Key Insights
	•	Top product pairings reveal cross-sell potential in high-margin segments.
	•	Identified discount thresholds where profit begins to erode.
	•	Regional and category-level analysis highlights underperforming areas.
	•	Enabled merchandising and pricing teams to act faster using visual drill-downs.

## Dashboard Applications
	•	Merchandising: Bundle frequently co-purchased products.
	•	Pricing: Adjust discount ranges to protect margins.
	•	Placement: Prioritize visibility for high-lift categories.
	•	Performance Tracking: Monitor KPIs by time, region, or customer type.

## Tech Stack

Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Modeling (Star Schema), Retail Analytics

## Limitations
	•	Based on sample Superstore data; insights are illustrative.
	•	Correlation-based — product combos imply relationship, not causation.
	•	Not live; refresh depends on connected data pipeline or manual update.
